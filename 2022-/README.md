1. Integral Array (diff=1800, ad-hoc)
I'm actually quite amazed someone cannot solve this problem in contest, because I believe we've studied this technique for at least 10 times in the 2020 training :).
Just use the property of partial sum n/1 + n/2 + ... + n/n = O(nlogn), manipulate the y value, and also the quotient. https://codeforces.com/contest/1649/problem/D
