I timed this practice, and I successfully solved 11 out of 12 problems within 2.5 hours.
The final question was quite regret, as long as I've solved the latin-America-2019 problem B instead of escaped, I can get it.

A. Australian vs American (simulation)
[solved] simple, just 6 cases

B. Bombs Ahoy! (line sweep, range tree, bfs)
[solved] The only interesting problem in this set. Firstly, we solve offline what's the first time a cell is painted.
Then, based on this info, we do bfs to get what's the shortest distance from starting point to any cell.
The final cell must be a safe cell.

C. Cryptic Clues (simulation)
[solved] Just brute force all partition points, the only optimization is only do string comparision when the strings are equal length.

D. Dubious Recordings (calculate contribution)
[solved] Too routine.


E. Easiest Problem (simulation)
[solved] Login.

F. Flow (primary school math)
[solved] Login.

G. Godâ€™s Number (constructive algorithm)
[solved] Just work backward and for each operation, do it 3 times.

H. Holiday (line sweep)
[solved] Just a standard 2-pointer problem.

I. Island of Love (union find)
[solved] Just work backward and apply union-find.

J. Juice Machine (dp)
[solved] Just multiply everything by 2520 (lcm of 1 to 10), and the problem is a very simple dp.

K. Krazy Taxi (dfs)
[solved] Login.

L. Love Actually (binary search on final answer)
[unsolved] Just use the idea of latin-america-2019 to solve it. The only take away is don't escape.
