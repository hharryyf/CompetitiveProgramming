Did this practice with Tom and Edward. We solved 5/6 problems during this practice, I solved 3.

A. Div. 7 [solved by me] (diff=800, login)
Just manipulate the digit, we need to change at most 1.

B. Minority [solved by Tom] (diff=800, login)
The method he used during the contest was way too overkill. Just sweep from let to right, taks the max of the minority along the way is fine.

C. Kill the Monster [solved by me] (diff=1100, simple math)
Just a very simple math problem.

D. Make Them Equal [solved by Edward] (diff=1600, simple dp)
Just a simple knapsack dp, if we want to modify a number a[i], we definitely want to make it equal to b[i].
Just precalculate the minimum step to increase from 1 to v, and run the knapsack dp.

E. Spanning Tree Queries [solved by me] (diff=2400, kruskal, ad-hoc)
Note that there are only C(M, 2) many critical points, the relative order of weights of the edges does not change between these critical points.
We can run Kruskal C(M, 2) many times. https://codeforces.com/contest/1633/problem/E
