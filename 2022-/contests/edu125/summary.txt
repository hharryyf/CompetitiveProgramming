I did this one virtually with Edward. We did pretty bad, solved 4 out of 6 problems and spent a lot of time.

The main reason for the slow and bad performance is Edward targeted E from almost the first minute of the contest and gave me no
support on problem D.

A. Integer Moves [solved by me] (diff=800, log in..)
Just case work. 

B. XY Sequence [solved by me] (diff=800, greedy)
Just the simpliest greedy strategy, put X until it exceeds B, put some Y, repeat.

C. Bracket Sequence Deletion [solved by Edward] (diff=1200, ad-hoc)
The idea is to observe the first two characters of an interval. There are 4 cases:
1) "()", then it's good because of balance
2) "((", then it's palindrome
3) "))", then it's palindrome
4) ")(", then we need to keep scaning to the right until we meet the first ")".

D. For Gamers. By Gamers. [solved by me] (diff=2000, harmonic sum, simple dp, binary search)
No comment. This problem could be done much quicker, if I had not told Edward someone has solved problem E.

E. Star MST [fail] (diff=2200, dp)
