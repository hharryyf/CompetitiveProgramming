I can only solve 4/6 problems in this set. These problems are very annoying. For example D, I got wrong answer for 4 times,
very easy to make mistakes. 

A. String Building [solved] (diff=800, math)
Just see if there's a connected component of characters of size 1.

B. Consecutive Points Segment [solved] (diff=1000, brute force)
We only need to consider 3 possibilities of the first position.

C. Dolce Vita [solved] (diff=1200, greedy)
We need to sort all the numbers in descending order. Then the answer is just several days we have n items,
several days n-1 items ...

D. Insert a Progression [solved] (diff=1600, ad-hoc)
It's a very tricky one. We basically need to consider where we should place 1 (if the minimum in array a is greater than 1) and X
(if the maximum in a is less than X). This can be done by sweeping and a multiset.

E. Preorder [fail] (diff=2100, dp)
The observation is we can group the prefix string into equivalent groups. To judge if two equivalent groups are equal, we just need to 
see if the strings with the least lexicographical order are equal. We define dp[v] as the number of different strings at node v.
Then if L[v] and R[v] are not equivalent. The answer to v is equal to dp[L[v]] * dp[R[v]] * 2. Otherwise, it is dp[L[v]] * dp[R[v]]. 

F. Permutation Counting [fail] (diff=2700)
To hard...
