This virtual contest is very boring, since E has rating 2600, way beyond our problem solving ability, I didn't gain much from it.
Next time, if problem E has rating strictly above 2400, I will definitely not practice that set.

A.  Playoff [coded by me] (diff=800, login)

B. Prove Him Wrong [coded by Edward] (diff=800, login)

C. Fault-tolerant Network [coded by Edward] (diff=1500, greedy, case work)
We have the following cases 
(1) a[1] --> b[n], b[1] --> a[n].
(2) a[1] --> b[1], a[n] --> b[n].
(3) a[1] --> b[n], b[1] with a[x] such that |b[1] - a[x]| is minimum, a[n] with b[y] such that |a[n] - b[y]| is minimum
(4) similar to (3), 3 edges just let a[1] --> b[1]
(5) similar to (3), b[1] --> a[n]
(6) simlar to (3), b[n] --> a[n]
(7) link 4 edges 

D. Nearest Excluded Points [coded by Edward] (diff=1900, shortest path, BFS)
This problem is quite sad, I kept thinking sqrt tricks, but actually the simplest solution works. Just put all the points that's not in the 
forbidden points but adjacent to at least 1 forbidden points as the sources, and run BFS. To avoid TLE, we mustn't push any not forbidden points
into the queue.
