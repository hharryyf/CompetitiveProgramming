We successfully solved 8 problems in the practice https://codeforces.com/contest/1267


A. Apprentice Learning Trajectory (diff=2400, greedy, line sweep)
[solved by Ali] I believe this question was overcomplicated during the contest. The idea is to create two events for each interval,
one is (l+t, 0, ti), the other is (r, 1, ti). Then, we sort these events according to timestamp then by add/delete, then by ti.
After that we just sweep through these events and a key observation at this stage is integer division can help the process a lot.


B. Balls of Buma (diff=900, ad-hoc)
[solved by me] Observe that the string has some symmetry, we need to reduce the left/right block of same letter together. 


E. Elections (diff=1700, greedy)
[solved by me] We can manipulate which candidate can tie/beat the last candidate, and in order for this to happen, we can firstly
remove the station that can reduce the difference most violently.


F. Foolpr√ºf Security (diff=2600, constructive algorithm)
[solved by Ali] This question is very difficult. 


I. Intriguing Selection (diff=2600, constructive algorithm)
[solved by Dallas] I'm quite amazed that Dallas said this question is simple... The idea is we can maintain two sets, one of size 2, the other of size n - 1.
Then, we eliminate the minimum of the two sets. And add a new number to the two sets with smaller size, and repeat the same process for n - 1 times.
After that, the remaining n items are the results.


J. Just Arrange the Icons (diff=1800, greedy)
[solved by Ali] This is a simple greedy question.


K. Key Storage (diff=2100, combinatorics)
[solved by Dallas and me] We need to satisfy two conditions, 1) 0 cannot be at the final position, 2) the divisor must be greater than the divisor.
We can ignore 1) at first and subtract the invalid ones after we have calculated 2). 2) is a very simple combinatorics problem. 


L. Lexicography (diff=1800, greedy, constructive algorithm)
[solved by Dallas] I solved this problem before, and it's pretty simple. Just greedily construct until the tie is broken.
