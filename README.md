Code for programming competition

This repo contains all my code for competitive programming training. My cp journey is quite short. I started doing ICPC in the middle of 2019, after failing badly in the 2019 south
pacific divisional contest, I started to do intensive traning. In 2020, my individual problem solving number was around 1200. And in 2020, our team ranked 2nd in the ICPC south pacific 
regional final. However, due to the one team per uni rule, we failed to quality the WF. To fulfill the WF dream, I made a new team in 2021, and did regular training again for a year, 
however, quite ironically, our team ranked 2nd again in the regional final and failed to enter the WF (despite I firmly believe the 2021 SPPC 1st place team cheated in the regional final).
However, cp is one of my interest. Even if I graduated in May 2022, I'll continue the fun journey.
