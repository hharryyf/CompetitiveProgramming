This directory consists of the 4 problems that me and my previous team failed to solve during training in December 2020.


K. Tournament Wins (expected value trick, probability)
[unsolved] We want to calculate E[x] = sum(i*p(i), i = 1..k) which p(i) is the probability of winning 
exactly i matches. However, this is very difficult to be calculated, we should realize that the above expression
is also equal to sum(Q(i), i = 1..k) which Q(i) = sum(p(j), j = i..k)
To calculate Q(i), the probability of winning no less than i matches, it is simply equal to
c(2^k-r, 2^i-1) / c(2^k-1, 2^i-1). Note that this might cause accuracy issues, if we want to calculate this fraction, we can use logs.

L. Windy Path (constructive algorithm, greedy, convex-hull)
[unsolved] This problem is very difficult. We can just start from the leftmost and bottom most point, then keep applying the following rule,
if we meet L then we find the right most point that satisfies we can turn left, otherwise, we find the leftmost point that satisfies we can turn right.
This can be proved by the convex hull property.
